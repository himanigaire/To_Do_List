  Contains the functionality for adding tasks, marking them as completed, deleting tasks, and clearing all tasks.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Users can add new tasks to the list using the input field.
- **Complete Task**: Each task can be marked as completed using a checkbox, and the task text will be crossed out.
- **Delete Task**: Each task has a delete button to remove it from the list.

## Future Enhancements

- **Task Categories**: Implement task categorization to group tasks.
- **Save Tasks Locally**: Use local storage to save tasks, so they persist after refreshing the page.
